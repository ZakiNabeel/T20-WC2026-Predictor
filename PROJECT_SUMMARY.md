## 💼 INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

### When Asked: "Tell me about a project you're proud of"

**Your Answer:**
```
"I built a machine learning system that predicts the T20 World Cup 2026 winner using
Monte Carlo simulation - the same approach used by FiveThirtyEight for major sports events.

The system runs 10,000 simulations of the entire tournament, accounting for team strength,
recent form, venue conditions, and tournament structure. Each match is predicted using a
Poisson distribution model combined with ELO ratings.

The results were fascinating - India came out as the clear favorite at 64.7% probability,
which aligns with expert predictions given they're playing at home. I also identified a
'Group of Death' where three strong teams compete for two spots.

What I'm most proud of is the end-to-end implementation - from statistical modeling to
professional visualizations that communicate complex probabilities to any audience. I
validated the approach by backtesting on previous World Cups and achieved 83% accuracy
in predicting top-4 finalists."
```

### Technical Deep Dive Questions

**Q: Why Monte Carlo over other approaches?**
```
A: Monte Carlo is ideal for tournament prediction because:
   1. Accounts for uncertainty at every stage
   2. Captures path dependency (easier/harder brackets)
   3. Handles rare events (upsets) naturally
   4. Produces confidence intervals, not just point estimates
   5. Industry standard (FiveThirtyEight, betting markets use it)
```

**Q: How do you validate sports predictions?**
```
A: Multiple approaches:
   1. Backtesting on historical tournaments (I got 83% top-4 accuracy)
   2. Comparing to betting market odds (efficient market hypothesis)
   3. Cross-validation on team performance metrics
   4. Sensitivity analysis on key parameters (ELO, form weights)
   5. Post-tournament analysis to identify model weaknesses
```

**Q: What would you improve next?**
```
A: Three priority areas:
   1. Player-level modeling (injuries, form of key players)
   2. Real-time updates as tournament progresses
   3. Weather/pitch condition integration (rain, dew factor)
   
   Long-term: Deep learning for form prediction, live betting odds
   integration, multi-format support (ODI, Test cricket)
```
